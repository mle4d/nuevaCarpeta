                  <p>Hi! I'm Mle, thanks for taking the time to look at my portfolio!
                    I am actively seeking my first role in tech, that may be why you're here!
                    My experience in coding dates way back to the days of neopets, where I first 
                    encountered HTML & CSS, then a couple years later Myspace's function to design your profile yourself
                    led me to learning more & also introduced me to Javascript, I even took a couple coding classes in high 
                    school because I loved it so much! After High School, & the days of Myspace fading away, I didn't code anything for years, 
                    though I always "craved" it, I just didn't have anything to code anymore! I worked in retail, was an artist by commission & 
                    became a certified floral designe as my "first" career. After I had my son in 2016, it quickly became clear that continuing 
                    in the floral industry would as a single mom just wasn't financially possible, I knew I had to figure out a new career path.
                    Once while googling "good careers" or something like that, I came across "software developer" & looked into it, it turned out 
                    a software developer was a job where I could do what I used to do as a hobby when I was a teenager, who knew?! I was beyond rusty
                    when it came to coding, it had been a good eight years or so since I had done any of it, but software development continued to be the only
                    second-career choice out there I kept coming across that sparked something. Not just an interest but excitement & encouraged by the fact that
                    I had enjoyed doing it so much previously. In 2019 I finally took the leap & moved to Portland Oregon to attend a six month full-stack 
                    Javascript program. There I learned & brushed up on HTML, CSS, Vaniila JS & then the MERN tech stack- MongoDB, Express, React/Redux & NodeJS.
                    At the tail end of September 2019 I graduated the six month program & have continued to self-study from there on. I still <i>really</i> love CSS, 
                    it's my favorite thing to do. I truly feel like CSS another artistic medium to add to my physical mediums that can be used to create whatever idea 
                    I come up with, & that is so satisfying & fun for me to make that happen.
